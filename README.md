# Simple-Player-Prostitution-SE

You can make money in the temple of Dibella or Taverns as a prostitute, after renting a room and asking permission from Innkeepers, 
or everywhere as a dibellan or a beggar. The payment that you could receive increases based on your Speech skills. 
 You could contract STDs while working, which are like Vanilla diseases, but only healers (Alchemy shop owners and some other NPCs) could cure them.
In the first stage of STDs, they could be cured by using potions for minor STDs.
